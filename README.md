 # eShopOnContainers with NServiceBus

This repo has been archived. The original code is in the [archive branch](https://github.com/Particular/eShopOnContainers/tree/archive). It was built as a variation of Microsoft's [sample application](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers) using NServiceBus but it is NOT indicative of how we recommend microservices should be built. If you have any questions about how to design for microservices, or for distributed systems in general, please [contact us](https://particular.net/contact).
